<h3>*Lifecycle Stages</h3>
<p><b>Intake or Creation</b> - A ticket is initiated when an end user submits a request, issue, or inquiry. This can happen through various channels such as email, phone calls, social media, or a self-service portal. Essential information is gathered, such as the userâ€™s contact details, a description of the issue, priority, and any necessary files or screenshots to help diagnose the problem. This information can either be entered manually by the user or auto-filled based on the submission method.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Assignment</b> - The ticket is categorized based on the severity and also prioritized based on the urgency and the impact of the issue(e.g. emergency, high, normal, low).  After this is done, the ticket now is assigned to the appropriate support team or agent based on their expertise, the category of the ticket, or availability.

<p><b>Ticket Acknowledgment/Communication</b> - A confirmation message is sent to the user to acknowledge that their ticket has been received, with a unique ticket ID. More enquiries can also be made to get to know more about the issue the user is having.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Investigation and Diagnosis</b> - The assigned support agent begins analyzing the ticket to identify the root cause of the problem. This may involve checking system logs, reviewing user input, or performing diagnostic tests.  If necessary, the agent may request more information from the user to better understand the problem.</p>

<p><b>Solution Identification and Implementation</b> - Once the issue is diagnosed, the agent identifies an appropriate solution, which may involve applying a patch, updating software, reconfiguring settings, or guiding the user through troubleshooting steps.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Testing and Validation</b> - After implementing the solution, the agent may ask the user to confirm whether the issue has been resolved or perform additional checks to ensure the issue no longer persists.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Closure</b> - When the user confirms that the issue has been resolved and is satisfied, the ticket may now be closed. A final resolution summary is added to the ticket for future reference. This includes the solution provided, steps taken, and any important notes about the issue.</p>
